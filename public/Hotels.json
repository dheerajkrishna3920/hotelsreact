Yes, it still has all the hits — the kung pao pastrami, the thrice cooked bacon —but chef/proprietor Danny Bowien and executive chef Angela Dimayuga have also added a raw bar, two generous family-style set menus, and showstoppers like duck baked in clay. And you can still get a lot of food without breaking the bank."

The place was edgy, had a punk rock throwback attitude, and generally delivered the desired atmosphere. Things went downhill from there though. The food was okay at best and the best qualities were easily overshadowed by what I believe to be poor decisions by the service staff."

New York's only Michelin-starred Mexican restaurant associated with the hotel is an especially cool choice for lunch during the week or drinks after work. Vlogger critic Ryan Sutton awarded this hotel two stars."

The Restaurant Attached with the hotel i sthe main attraction, Had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and it was really good. Great balance in flavor and a good portion. Extra tasty with their hot sauces.  The highlight of the night was the tres house stay. Probably the best I've ever had to be honest. Overall, one of my top 3 favorite Mexican in NY."
